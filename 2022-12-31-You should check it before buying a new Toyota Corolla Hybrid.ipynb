I already decided the car, it was Toyota Corolla Hybrid, it was looking reliable, fuel efficient and good size for trunk. Also it is exciting to try new tech so being hybrid was also influencing. It was the [third most selling car](https://www.arabam.com/blog/genel/2022-yili-turkiyede-en-cok-satilan-arabalar/) so it should be rather easy to sell it if I wanted to. As most people do, I’ve went and checked eksisozluk which would have an opinon as most of the things. Bu there were various ideas, some liked some not and decided to check for keywords about chronic problems etc.\n",
